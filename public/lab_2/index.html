    <p>Dear Dover,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at UMD's iSchool to study for your undergraduate in 2020. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 29 August 2020</li>
        <li>Second semester: 22 January 2021</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2021</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
